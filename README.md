# 8-bit_game
Pygame is a python library that can be used specifically to design and build games. Pygame supports only 2d games that are built 
using different sprites. Pygame is not particularly best for designing games as it is very complex to use doesnâ€™t have a proper
GUI like unity but it definitely builds logic for further complex projects.
